the
 
reactor,
 
which
 
is
 
operated
 
at
 
40
 
to
 
100
 
bar
 
pressure.
 
This
 
process
 
produces
 
a
  
synthesis
 
gas
 
rich
 
in
 
hydrogen
 
(H2),
 
carbon
 
monoxide
 
(CO)
 
and
 
carbon
 
dioxide
 
(CO2),
 
making
 
it
 
suitable
  
for
 
further
 
use
 
in
 fuel cell 
technology.. The synthesis gas obtained is then cooled and the carbon dioxide  is separated by amine scrubbing.
